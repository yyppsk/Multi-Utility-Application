Overall Description 

Product Perspective 

Our application is combined with various task-oriented features, which makes it a centralized location for achieving various tasks in one go. The version 1.0 includes all basic to advanced features of our listed specifications. Our perspective about multi utility is achieved by providing management tasks and security tasks as well. 

 

One can simply navigate in the application to achieve results without exploring internet connections. All the mathematical tool, financial tool, password tool, management tool is designed by keeping in mind the practical uses of daily life. 

Product Features 

The major features the product contains or the significant functions that it performs or lets the user perform. Menu driven program lets user navigate easily. The choices are numeric and both texts based, so it gives user a seamless experience during navigation and keeps hassle away. 

 

User interface is divided into classes for reducing any further redundancies. It is made sure that object-oriented logics are used inside application to enhance the reliability of program and its experience is made better. 

 

Selective approach towards each problem set makes it easier to get solutions to any tasks needed. One with basic knowledge of Command interface and inputs can navigate easily throughout the program. 

User Classes and Characteristics 

The various user classes that we anticipate will use this product can come from any categories. User classes may be differentiated based on frequency of use, subset of product functions used, technical expertise, security or privilege levels, educational level, or experience. 

 

From a very basic approach of providing menu driven application provides us with ability to reach to almost everyone with basic knowledge about giving inputs in a command line interface. 

 

The application is suitable for all age groups and usages, because of its general features like Calculations, taxes, evaluation of finances, managing your passwords etc. 

 

Basic Users: Can operate the application for Calculative tasks and using notes features 

 

Medium Users: Can operate the Basic user’s task with calculating advanced calculator for their daily purpose tasks without any internet connectivity. 

 

Advanced Users: Can operate all features of application easily with password management to other management features we have built in. 

Operating Environment 

Our application works on Windows and Linux environments with no special requirments. When we require very high-level mathematical computations, performance and speed become important. Hence most of the libraries use C++ as their core programming language. Most high-level machine language libraries use C++ as a backend. 

C++ is faster than most of the other programming languages and also supports multithreading with concurrency. Thus in Applications where speed along with concurrency is required, C++ is the most sought-after language for development. 

Apart from speed and performance, C++ is also close to hardware and we can easily manipulate hardware resources using C++ low-level functions. Thus C++ becomes the obvious choice in applications that require low-level manipulations and hardware programming. 

 

Design and Implementation Constraints 

C++ is close to the hardware, can easily manipulate resources, provide procedural programming over CPU-intensive functions, and is fast. It is also able to override the complexities of 3D games and provides multilayer networking. All these benefits of C++ make it a primary choice to develop the gaming systems as well as game development suites. 

C++ can be used to develop most of the GUI-based and desktop applications easily as it has got the required features. 

Some examples of GUI based applications, written in C++, are as follows: 

Adobe Systems 

Most of the applications of the adobe systems including Illustrator, Photoshop, etc. are developed using C++. 

User Documentation 

We have kept an easy interface for easy navigation throughout the application seamlessly and effortlessly. We have applied Data Structures to our application to optimize the usage and functionality. All Conversions and Units in our application are well maintained and organized by Standard formulations. Our application focuses on common tasks like, Calculations, Daily Essentials, Basic Management Applications. The primary goal of this application is to provide necessary tasks and requirements. 

 

 

 

 

 

System Features 

The program doesn’t rely on any extra special dependencies, it requires basic inputs to create a workflow and generate an output. Some core elements are featured in this section. 

Private Vault 

Introduction 

As many of you know, safety has been our #1 priority and we have been putting the safety of our users’ funds above everything and anything. Today, we are proudly presenting our latest product, a unique private vault system, which adds another layer of security. 

What is a Private Vault? 

Private vaults are owned by only one single user. This means that one vault allows for only one depositor. These private vaults are created as a complement to our wonderful community and users who provide liquidity and want to compound manually with absolutely no fees which are solely available for our audience with absolutely no monetary donations. 

Key features 

Below are some key features and differences between of our private vaults: 

Privacy: You own what is solely yours. You will have your own vault contract which you can directly interact with, via our advanced encryption system SHA256. 

Security: As a custom vault that is owned by only you, and allows only you to deposit, it makes these vaults increasingly secure. 

Compounding: Although we only support manual compounding now, with a little bit of programming skills, you could create your own bot to do the auto-compounding if you wish so. Our team will try to create a toolkit or sample so you can quickly create your own butler-bot to run on your computer or as a serverless application. 

SHA256: SHA- is one of the successor hash functions to SHA-1 (collectively referred to as SHA-2) and is one of the strongest hash functions available. SHA-256 is not much more complex to code than SHA-1 and has not yet been compromised in any way. The 256-bit key makes it a good partner-function for AES. It is defined in the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) standard ‘FIPS 180-4’. NIST also provide a number of test vectors to verify correctness of implementation. There is a good description at Wikipedia.

User interface follows a menu driven approach, which makes it easier to follow up and navigate through the program. 

 

Each menu subdivides into further menu’s if needed, and every function is called with respect to each corresponding menu item. 

 

Suppose: 

 

Menu 1, Menu 2, Menu 3 … Menu n  

Each menu entry can contain a sub menu. 

 

Menu 1: Menu 1.1 Menu 1.2 Menu 1.3…. Menu 1.n 

 

For each menu, there also exists a calling function statement. 

 

Menu 1 

Menu 2 

Sub Menu 

Feature 1  à Calls function feature1 () 

Feature 2 à Calls function feature2 () 

Feature 3 à Calls function feature3 () 

Feature 4  à Calls function feature4 () 

. 

. 

Feature n à Calls function feature n () 

 

Each function feature is defined as objects for a Class.
